Let's start with a simple Java program. We'll create a program that greets the user. Here's an example code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print a greeting to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Now, let's break down what's happening:

- `public class HelloWorld`: This defines a class named "HelloWorld." In Java, every program consists of at least one class.

- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the `main` method, which serves as the entry point for the program. All Java programs start execution from this method.

- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: This line of code prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. The `println` method is responsible for printing the string and adds a newline at the end.

Now, let's see how to run this program:

1. Write this code in a text editor such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Save the file with the ".java" extension, for example, "HelloWorld.java."

3. Open the command prompt (or terminal) and navigate to the directory where your file is located.

4. Compile the program by entering `javac HelloWorld.java` in the command prompt.

5. Run the compiled program by entering `java HelloWorld`.

You should see the output "Hello, World!" on the screen.

This is a simple program that serves as a great starting point for beginners. Gradually, you can explore more advanced concepts such as variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
